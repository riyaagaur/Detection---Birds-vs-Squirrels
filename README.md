## Detection - Birds Vs Squirrels

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the detection and classification of images, specifically differentiating between birds and squirrels. Using deep learning models, the project demonstrates how image data can be processed, trained, and classified into distinct categories with high accuracy.

## Features
- Data Processing: Efficient preprocessing techniques, including resizing and normalization, are applied to the dataset to prepare it for model training.
- Model Training: A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is trained to detect birds and squirrels in images.
- Evaluation: The model’s performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and other relevant metrics.
- Visualization: Various visualization techniques are employed to show the detection results and model performance.

## Notebooks
– Image_Detection_1: Contains the initial setup, including loading the dataset and performing the initial data preprocessing steps.
- Image_Detection_2: Focuses on model building and training using CNNs.
- Image_Detection_3: Evaluates the trained model and visualizes the results.
